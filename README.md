|----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Task 1   |  To-Do List (CLI)             | A command-line based task manager    |
| Task 2   |  Basic Calculator             | A calculator for basic math operations |
| Task 3   |  Rock-Paper-Scissors Game     | A fun console game vs computer       |


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **IDE**: Google Colab   
- **Libraries Used**: `random` (for Task 3 only)  
- **Platform**: Command-Line Interface (CLI)



## 📌 Task Details


### 🔹 Task 1: To-Do List Application

**Objective**: Create a command-line based To-Do List where users can add, view, and remove tasks.

**Features**:
- Add new tasks
- Show all current tasks
- Remove specific tasks by number
- Exit the program safely

**Code Structure**:
- List data structure to store tasks
- Functions for each operation (`add_new_task`, `show_task`, `remove_task`)
- Menu-driven interface using a `while` loop


### 🔹 Task 2: Basic Calculator

**Objective**: Develop a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

**Supported Operations**:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (**)

**Features**:
- User input for two numbers and an operator
- Input validation for division by zero
- Simple and clean output


### 🔹 Task 3: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

**Objective**: Build a Rock-Paper-Scissors game that a user can play against the computer.

**Features**:
- Input validation for user choices
- Randomized computer choices
- Game logic to determine the winner
- Score tracking for player and computer
- Option to play multiple rounds

**Modules Used**:
- `random` for computer’s random choice
